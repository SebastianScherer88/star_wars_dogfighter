Welcome to `Star Wars Dogfighter`! 

Please read below for a short game description, how to run the demo version and player controls.

## Summary

This is a game I wanted to do for some time. It's a classic 2D, top-down shooter with where the player shoots down enemy ships while being
supported by ally ships. I had a lot of fun working on this game, and hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
